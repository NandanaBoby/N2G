### Project Description
Brain Bae is an innovative web application to help students find like-minded peers for academic collaboration.In this fast-paced academic world,it is challenging to study effectively alone.Brain Bae solves this by matching students based on their courses,study habits and preferences.
Users create profiles with their academic interests, subjects,study times and methods.The app uses an intelligent matching algorithm to suggest potential study partners.Once matched,students can message each other and schedule study sessions.
Benefits:
-Connects students globally,enabling diverse academic collabortion
-helps improve academic performance by encouraging effective study partnerships
-Fosters knowledge exchange across different fields of study,enhancing learning outcomes.
### The Problem statement
Students often struggle to find compatible study partners,limiting collaboration and knowledge exchange.Traditional methods are restricted to local networks,reducing networks efficinecy.Brain Bae solves this by 
matching students based on their courses,study habits and preferences,fostering effective academic collaboration and improved learning outcomes.
### The Solution
By creating an web application which bring like-minded students together from all over the world for collaborative study session.
