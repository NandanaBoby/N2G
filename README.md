### Project Description
Brain Bae is an innovative web application to help students find like-minded peers for academic collaboration.In this fast-paced academic world,it is challenging to study effectively alone.Brain Bae solves this by matching students based on their courses,study habits and preferences.
Users create profiles with their academic interests, subjects,and their field of expertise.The app uses an intelligent matching algorithm to suggest potential study partners.Once matched,students can message each other and schedule study sessions.
Benefits:
-Connects students globally,enabling diverse academic collabortion
-helps improve academic performance by encouraging effective study partnerships
-Fosters knowledge exchange across different fields of study,enhancing learning outcomes.

### The Problem statement
Students often struggle to find compatible study partners,limiting collaboration and knowledge exchange.Traditional methods are restricted to local networks,reducing networks efficinecy.

### The Solution
Brain Bae solves this by matching students based on their courses,study habits and preferences,fostering effective academic collaboration and improved learning outcomes.

### Project Demo
# Video
[![Watch the Video](Media/ui1.png)](Media/video.mp4)

Shows a user with their name, age, skills, and the field of their expertise.
When we decline, it shows a popup message and shows the next available user
Once we accept, it gets redirected to a chat page, where you both can discuss on being study partners and fix on a meetup time.
